# Calculator

[An exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) made for Project Odin. Made use of everything learned until that point in the Foundations curriculum. All optional assignments have been taken care of, with some personal extras.

Keyboard and mouse inputs are both supported and the calculator can chain operations.

I may revisit the project later to refactor the code and add a better display.

I'm not fond of the behavior when hitting an operator twice, but for now improving this is out of scope.
